<p>by lazyLambda</p>
<h1 id="context">CONTEXT</h1>
<p>You will want to read this if you are interested in the growth of the Haskell userbase.</p>
<p>At Ace we operate very strictly on a number of key beliefs about technology and human learning + development as they relate to developers achieving a role that satisfies their ikigai. We have begun this monthly update to share what we learn about this broad yet deeply important intersection as we don&#39;t think we are the only 3 who deeply care about this.</p>
<p>They will often be short updates, but as we are now 9 months in, this first update will be more extensive, starting with why did we even begin on this? The primary motivation is that the job we get is the single most important determinant of our quality of life. For brevity I won’t deliberate on them here but there are statistics clearly indicating how one&#39;s job affects their income, mental health, and relationship outcomes among many other things.</p>
<p>While Ace Talent Community is 9 months old, my drive for a better system in hiring is now zero-ing in on 9 years. It is my 4th serious attempt at fixing hiring and the one I hold the most faith in, due to Haskell specifically. 9 years ago, I was in business school with no exposure to FP or even programming. I achieved the grades needed to enter the co-op stream, and just needed to pass a simple 10 minute interview. One week prior however, my grandpa passed away. I felt off but was lucky to have little experience with grief and so I chose to continue on with my interview. I have never fumbled on my words so hard as I did that day. Very little to my surprise, I was 100% out of the program rendering my choice of business over mathematics to be the wrong choice for me.</p>
<p>While today I look back and I am eternally grateful for that 10 minutes of broken English and reversed words out of my mouth, it was devastating. I felt that I had destroyed my entire career. I became depressed, addicted to marijuana, and was dumped by my girlfriend all in the next 4 months. Fast forward 9 years and I&#39;m obsessed with Haskell and I&#39;m happy, but it made me realize the gravity of the situation. Not just the gravity of 10 minutes, but a silly few seconds of a first impression is something that can break a pathway forward. Not that it should but humans are emotional creatures often trying to mask that with logic and reason.</p>
<p>I recognize that my situation was specific but that doesn&#39;t mean many others don&#39;t face their own unique and also frustrating cases with the hiring process.</p>
<p>Outside of people who&#39;ve worked one job ever, I do not know anyone who hasn&#39;t felt that their side of the hiring process is awful... whether that&#39;s hiring managers who&#39;ve had to eventually fire or someone who struggles with small talk and promoting themselves.</p>
<p>To state that we feel there is a disconnect between the company hiring and job seekers submitting applications is an understatement. Whether it&#39;s the classic debate of skill vs. personality or the fact that job applications deal with as much as 10k applications from potential bots and then filter it through bots that check for the &quot;optimal&quot; existence of keywords to see what&#39;s worth reading. Or that you can interview 1,000 candidates and a shocking amount would fail a simple coding challenge or worse yet, do well on this challenge only to be clearly overpromoting their past experience as they struggle with basics on the job. Which is arguably even fair as it&#39;s a complex market where it is currently economically infeasible to &quot;strike a price&quot; on skill. Like how companies will ask for 10 years experience with a library that&#39;s 5 years old (I joke here, but not fully) then perhaps it makes sense that the dev says &quot;yes I do have 10 years experience in that plus these other 40 frameworks you have listed&quot;.
Perhaps you personally haven&#39;t experienced hiring problems yet but it&#39;s no secret they exist.</p>
<p>At a bare minimum we can likely agree it is hard for certain companies to scale with respect to finding great talent they mend well with ... and it is hard for devs to prove they are truly ready for a serious role.</p>
<h1 id="thesis">THESIS</h1>
<p>For both of these reasons, Haskell is the perfect place for Ace to begin to change hiring, with software engineering. In our discussions with Haskell companies we have found it to be challenging to scale by adding senior engineers. Haskell is also the most dramatically underrated way to actually properly learn programming. In light of recent discussions I&#39;ve had in the Matrix Haskell channel, the learning of Haskell itself is what I&#39;d consider it&#39;s &quot;killer app&quot; but unfortunately your average r/learnprogramming discussion has people who hate haskell + FP as well as those who think simply false facts like &quot;Haskell is slow because you can&#39;t do mutation&quot;. We see it as much more of a testament to how dynamically typed languages and web-slop of JS has led to unjustified egos. For how allegedly &quot;culty&quot; and &quot;rude&quot; FP is according to the dynamically-typed community I sure feel super welcomed in my interactions.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; here but Haskell and FP more generally just supercharges your thinking in a way that is anything but language specific. I forget what r/haskell thread it was but &quot;you&#39;ll want to wear rubber gloves when using any other language after Haskell&quot; sums it up.</p>
<h1 id="the-actual-first-update">THE ACTUAL FIRST UPDATE</h1>
<p>In light of this contextual understanding, we pivoted from being Ace Interview Prep where we were focused on helping with soft-skill based (engineering::Any) interview questions that comprise a typical first interview. I built the entire platform myself using Obelisk, with help from my non-technical cofounder, Lauren, who I taught enough reflex-dom to help build pages. There was a second pivot as I was also freelancing with 3 other colleagues to find Haskell project opportunities. My one colleague and best friend, Kyle, pivoted with me to start Ace Talent. Both have also been involved since the first idea (Pathways; dev-focused, over-optimized.. failed)</p>
<p>Seeing as we had some experience under our belt, most notably from my time at Obsidian in 2021-2022 (grateful beyond words for their mentorship), and from building out Ace Interview Prep + my personal endeavours with Simple Haskell Youtube channel we felt that while we were not the best people to teach Haskell we were at least available and decently knowledgeable.</p>
<p>We began A.T.C. through our partnership that we had with Carnegie Mellon Africa (Rwanda) and held an info session on learning Haskell and our hypothesis as to how it can help them land a European job. We sent out ~500 invites, ~200 yes&#39;s and hosted ~25 actual online attendees. As you might have expected, we received questions like &quot;is Haskell dead?&quot; but refreshingly as they were still early in their career, we were able to have a high quality discussion with them about why Haskell is not dead and contrary to popular belief is the better route to learn over &quot;the most used language in the world&quot; JavaScript.</p>
<p>We hosted our first two sessions and had between 10-15 attendees each time. At the time we felt discouraged seeing how we had drop-off from the 25 and I guess we just didn&#39;t know what to expect.</p>
<p>In an effort to boost numbers, out of the potential 500 who would be notified by Carnegie Mellon about our sessions, we surveyed and found that most were focused on data science. Seeing as I had done a fair bit of work using Haskell in machine learning (a project that today lays unfinished) we went ahead with it. We had roughly 40 students show up! But silly enough, Kyle and I were hanging out with the session early in the morning and so rather dumbly we tried to be on the same call in the same room. My brain malfunctioned and also my lesson plan malfunctioned as I went waaaay too chaotically deep into music theory, which my project was based on, as I thought &quot;to understand data science it is important to understand the need to understand the domain itself you are studying&quot;. However most students were more so focused on tasks like data cleaning or “how do I use Python”. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly our attendance plummeted. Over the next 2 months we averaged 6 people and 3 of them were us! I genuinely considered giving up but it provided Kyle and I the opportunity to learn how to teach. Most notably it made us reflect in a way that is integral to the question: why Haskell? Why not JS? Simply put: quality over quantity. We initially viewed ourselves as a replacement to unknowledgeable tech recruiters who often send out huge quantities of crap, not all recruiters, but often enough to be annoying. So perhaps 3 people who we could shape to be Haskell gods wasn&#39;t such a bad thing. We also found ourselves simply inspired by who they are, what challenges they as a person have faced, and what they have their sights on.</p>
<p>But unfortunately we sucked. We honestly did. It was our core focus to figure out how to get better. We had this grand idea of how we can build a Discord-like chat on our platform so that we can categorize Chats for the user like Programming &gt; Haskell &gt; Servers &gt; Servant | Snap and users could ask specific questions and community magic would happen. But at 3 returning users...... it&#39;s not like we had much need to optimize. We also sucked at teaching Haskell. Kyle has been programming for nearly 15 years and I&#39;ve been obsessive over Haskell since 2020 at the start of Covid, with junior experience prior to that since 2017. We just hadn&#39;t seen much beginner-focused teaching of Haskell that wasn&#39;t a 2000 page book (Haskell Programming from First Principles) and it was hard to wrap into a session that was 1-2 hours. All 3 users were juniors and we not only had to consider how to teach Haskell verbally and simply but consider what holes they might have, which meant that only 3 users was a perfect count.</p>
<p>What happened next is one of my favourite milestones in that we figured out how to verbalize Haskell, at least not horribly. To give a sense of what I mean by verbalize, I didn&#39;t know what (<code>&lt;*&gt;</code>) was called besides maybe the applicative class function that is not pure but like sorry um no not pure as in purity which is ..<a href="...">...</a>.... but <em>looks up Hoogle and points</em> &quot;this thing, which allows you to uhhh ........... well you know... look at it!&quot;</p>
<p>I was very much understanding how it allows you to apply a function wrapped in a context to an appropriately typed variable wrapped in the same context but I had no idea how to speak that. We found ways to simplify the scope of the lesson at first so maybe we&#39;d only talk about &#39;Maybe&#39; and even avoid typeclasses altogether. The plan was always for lessons to be more than anything &#39;proof&#39; that yes you can use Haskell to do X and took inspiration from OOP style tutorials to just not explain everything which felt imperfect.</p>
<p>In response we tried teaching Parsing. Man, I felt stupid after because why did I forget that this was how Haskell clicked for me? My first project, scrappy, was just using Parsec for webscraping and I loved it. It was integral to me getting hired at Obsidian. It was so clear after that lesson that if we can teach one thing whole and well, it allows for us to add deep insight to the lesson that I craved to teach. For example, Parsing allows a platform for a teacher of FP to talk about how types are integral to security in a way that a junior can understand.</p>
<p>Fast forward through all of these lessons and we have adopted an approach where most lessons are a project that we build and as we complete particular pieces we reflect on why we did it this way and what benefits Haskell gives us, as well as how we should operate as developers, both in a language like Haskell or a duck typed language like JS, where we don&#39;t have Haskell as a guiding light. The result has been really engaged students who are comfortable to participate.</p>
<p>Through some outreach we have also steadily grown from 3 users per week to 12-20 in attendance at our weekly sessions. We have 26 total forks of our Haskell projects where 4 projects are outlined</p>
<ol>
<li>
CLI Todo app
</li>
<li>
CLI Tic Tac Toe app
</li>
<li>
Twitter Clone
</li>
<li>
Chat Server
</li>
</ol>
<p>and unofficially/unreleased:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
Space race (optimization + linear algebra)
</li>
<li>
Demonstrated contribution back to Haskell community, eg GHC contribution or library contribution.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have just recently had a student complete project 4 for the first time, a student who&#39;s been with us since nearly the beginning (and even before as a subscriber of Simple Haskell!).</p>
<p>Item 6. is something we both feel would help lift the ecosystem as a whole and will be valuable to the apprentices themselves. Arguably they have produced some code fitting of Item 6. as they&#39;ve welcomed it to be a contribution to my soon to be released library but that is of course not nearly as valuable an experience as contributing to GHC or even Agda for example.</p>
<p>We believe that given the recent decline of junior hiring, it is vital for those looking to break into the field to find a way to become senior level. We feel these projects, especially when done in Haskell, are much more representative of someone&#39;s skill level than a resume. We also spend an hour with them to review and critique the projects so that they can gain comfort with technical communication and so that we can be sure they haven&#39;t just ChatGPT&#39;d the crap out of it. Luckily (for us) Haskell and AI don&#39;t play well. Perhaps you can bypass project #1 that way but then you miss the whole point of project #1 and you&#39;ll just get stuck on project #2 if not #3.</p>
<p>What is perhaps the most remarkable thing is the emergence of these apprentices. One detail I neglected to mention was our shifts back and forth from beginner to intermediate classes which we are still wrestling about at a systems level. Currently we are more focused on teaching on the higher range of intermediate focused lessons as we are starting to not only get Haskell enthusiasts but also people who like Kyle and myself were coming from languages which are just not so elegant and rich as Haskell but do have a great deal of experience and can withhold their ego to see why they should learn Haskell. By the interactions they share, It is creating a community of people who are genuinely interested in Haskell and who are faster than ourselves to help out someone who is new to the language. This has been honestly beautiful to see as Kyle has been away and I&#39;ve been recovering from a concussion. We aren&#39;t the least bit surprised by this and the goal has always been that we can know speak well on their behalf to companies about how they are set to be leaders on the team, especially if they choose to go for an object-oriented company where the bar is lower than a typical Haskell shop in terms of senior status. A Haskell Senior Engineer is currently reliant on Item 6., and as one could guess is a little harder to nail down but we have plenty of ideas.</p>
<p>We have also recently been playing with the idea of &quot;Apprenticeship&quot;. At some point we received a few requests for simple app development projects and we had no time for them so we acted as a liaison to connect them to a suitable dev. To give a sense of why, one thing we will never do is use our community as a labour source to better our platform unless the pay will be generous. But let&#39;s say we did do that for a user, then have they gained real world experience? By this point of the update you may or may not say yes, on the basis of how legitimate we are as a company, and fair enough, we are early stage. But then you could argue early stage means more scope to comprehend so this is in fact even &quot;richer&quot; experience. My point is, this is about as objective an argument as whether or not a food tastes good; and thus how &quot;rich&quot; the experience is. This may be obvious but it&#39;s still often used as a heuristic in the context of 1000s of applicants shoving their resume in your inbox. We just think that these heuristics among massive mobs of resumes are soon to be obsolete and the core objective phenomena is the true &quot;richness&quot; of experience, that is richness defined in terms of the depth and breadth of one&#39;s understanding of real grounded truth, and how these truths relate, like if one understands whether or not laziness is possible in a mutable pass by reference language and why and when do we actually need a backend for a simple app?</p>
<p>But the one fatal flaw in my argument is the people stuff that you deal with on a project. I&#39;m not sure how I could replace my experience with a simulated one there and so perhaps that motivates having paired apprenticeships ideally with target companies, short enough to be justifiable risk to companies who may eventually hire these candidates we recommend. It&#39;s a current, bubbling thought we have so details aren&#39;t fleshed out but perhaps soon.</p>
<p>That is all for this one and this will be the longest post we ever have as we need some catch-up. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed following along with us :)</p>
